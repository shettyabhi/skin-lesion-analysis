# skin-lesion-analysis

Motivation:
Existing strategies for non-dermatologists to improve diagnostic accuracy of melanoma, a type of aggressive skin cancer,
include the use of reference textbooks, online resources, and consultation with a colleague.
This can lead to suboptimal referrals, delays in care, and errors in diagnosis and treatment.

Problem Statement:
We use machine learning algorithm to diagnose melanoma versus other skin lesions,
using images and patient metadata, namely age, sex and localisation.
We aim to improve patient outcome, measured by 5-year survival rate (which can range from 99% to 25%),
by using computer vision to aid early, accurate diagnosis of melanoma by non-dermatologists.
